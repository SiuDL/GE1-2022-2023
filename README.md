# Description of the project

This is project is to create an interactable robotic body floating on a display, the idea of a robot is inspired by Terminator.
The action performed in order to interact with this robot is through a set of buttons in front of this display. Once a button is pushed,
an interaction will be showcased like it changing its pose, rotating it or bopping it up and down, changing lighting effects etc.

## Proposal for project:

The initial proposal for this project is still similar however a few changes have been made. The intial plan was still to create an interactable robot but
instead I have it so that the robot is lying flat on its back and the interactions you have is by being able to pick apart the robot. Think of this like a
human anatomical body where you can pull apart its organs and inspect them.


With all this said, I have scaled down the project and decided to go with an alternative route as described in the description due to time contraints with FYP.

# Instructions on how to play

## Movement
To move around in the scene, use the following keyboard bindings:
* 'W' - Foward
* 'S' - Backward
* 'A' - Left
* 'D' - Right

## Interact
To interact with interactable objects like a button, use the following key binding:
* 'E' - Interact

## Camera
For looking around in the scene, simply move the mouse to rotate the camera

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
